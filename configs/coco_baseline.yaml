# Phase 1: COCO Baseline Validation
# Purpose: Sanity check - verify models work, measure general behavior

dataset:
  name: "coco"
  images_root: "data/coco/val2017"
  annotations_json: "data/coco/annotations/person_keypoints_val2017.json"

output:
  dir: "outputs/phase1_baseline/coco"

benchmark:
  # Start with subset for quick validation, increase as needed
  max_images: 150
  # Confidence threshold for joint detection
  min_conf: 0.3
  # All three implemented models
  models:
    - mediapipe
    - yolov8-pose
    - movenet
