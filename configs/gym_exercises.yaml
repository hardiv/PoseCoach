# Phase 2: Exercise-Specific Testing
# Purpose: Answer "do these models work for MY problem?"
# Real gym conditions with varied capture scenarios

dataset:
  name: "gym_exercises"
  images_root: "data/pa_wo"
  # Note: pa_wo may not have annotations - visual assessment will be primary
  annotations_json: null

output:
  dir: "outputs/phase2_gym"

benchmark:
  # Process all available gym exercise images
  max_images: null
  # Lower threshold for gym conditions (potentially challenging lighting/occlusion)
  min_conf: 0.2
  # All three implemented models
  models:
    - mediapipe
    - yolov8-pose
    - movenet

# Analysis focus for Phase 2:
# - Visual inspection of skeleton overlays
# - Model consistency across viewpoints (front, side, 45°)
# - Robustness to lighting conditions
# - Handling of clothing variations and occlusion
# - Performance on different body types
